# Twister 5 Source Code

Twister was a tool I made while learning to code in the late 2000's.
Do not consider it to be good code. More specifically, please do not
parse VMF files with regular expressions, that's stupid. Use a library
like [Sledge.Formats](https://github.com/LogicAndTrick/sledge-formats).

The only thing I've changed in the code is to remove the update check
(the site is long since dead) and upgrade the project to VS2022.
